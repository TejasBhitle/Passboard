# Passboard
A Simple Password Manager App written in Kotlin

A very small Project built in 2 days. May contain a few bugs, but might be fixed later.

It uses Google SignIn Authentication and allows to save EmailIDs, Passwords, Notes of websites or any resource in Realtime Cloud Database which also allows syncing data between devices and caches the data for Offline use.

It uses Firebase Realtime Database & Authentication Service for saving Data.

If you want to clone project and use it, you will have to generate your own google-services.json file from Firebase Console and add it to the App.
